# JetBot ROS Project

## Goals
1. Add and integrate an AprilTag sensor node for enhanced perception.
2. Integrate sensor with room map for semi-automated Apriltag traversing.
3. Automate room scanning and enable multipoint navigation from Apriltags observed.
4. Build out ROS project from ground up, integrating developed algorithms.

## Workflow
- Use feature branches for updates and new features.
- Test locally on a macbook pro.
- Deploy onto Jetson Nano JetBot Pro and test using ROS executables.
- Push and pull changes via Git for efficient development.

## Milestones
- [ ] Implement AprilTag sensor node.
- [ ] Integrate AprilTag data into navigation.
- [ ] Create automated room scanning functionality.
- [ ] Enable multipoint navigation.
- [ ] Refactor and update the ROS architecture.

Stay tuned for updates and progress!
